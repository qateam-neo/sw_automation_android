In order to use biometrics, you need to enable it on your device through your Android Settings under the "Security" section.

By enabling biometric login, you are allowing anyone who has a biometric stored on this device to access your account. Please review the biometrics stored on your device and make sure all should be authorized to access the account information through SmartWealth.

SmartWealth does not have access to your biometrics data.

For information on how Google uses and stores your biometrics and Keychain data, please see Google's Privacy Policy and Android Security Guides.
